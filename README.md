# Server-client
These apps are develop as a server-client app, meaning that every client is able to make new orders and consult all his previous orders, of course there is a log in and register frame. The server part gets the order by sockets and play with the DB, also it is in charge of sending real-time feedback (thx multithreading) notifying when a new order has made, and is capable of showing its status connections too, all of this while its in system tray.

kinda cool, aren't it?
